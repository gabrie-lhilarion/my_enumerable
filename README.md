# my_enumerable
Here I expose my own implemention of Ruby enumerable methods.
There are two (02) files in this project:
enumerable.rb : list of my enumerable methods.
test.rb: file test for enumerable methods

![Algorithm schema](./screenshot.png)

The goal here is to prove that there's no magic with Ruby’s enumerable methods.
